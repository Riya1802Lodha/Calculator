### Calculator Project Description

#### Overview:

This project involves creating a comprehensive Calculator app designed to perform both basic arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations. The app features a user-friendly interface with a focus on clarity and ease of use. The layout and design ensure that users can perform calculations efficiently and accurately.

#### Features:

**1. User Interface:**
   - **Design:** The app has a clean and intuitive design with a dark-themed gradient background for comfortable viewing. The layout adapts seamlessly to both portrait and landscape orientations.
   - **Buttons:** The calculator includes responsive buttons with clear labels and distinct colors for numbers and operations, making input straightforward.

**2. Basic Arithmetic Operations:**
   - **Functions:** The app supports standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - **Input:** Dedicated buttons are available for numbers 0-9, decimal points, and basic arithmetic operators.

**3. Advanced Mathematical Functions:**
   - **Trigonometric Functions:** Sine, cosine, tangent, and their inverse functions are included.
   - **Logarithmic Functions:** The app provides functions for common logarithm (log) and natural logarithm (ln).
   - **Exponential Functions:** Users can perform calculations involving e and powers of x (e.g., xÂ², xÊ¸).
   - **Other Functions:** Square root and absolute value calculations are also available.

**4. Specialized Functions:**
   - **Prime Number Checker:** The app includes a feature to determine if a number is prime.
   - **Error Correction:** A backspace button allows users to correct input mistakes.
   - **Reset:** A clear button is available to reset the current calculations.

**5. Display:**
   - **Output:** The display shows both the input and the results of calculations. It also keeps track of previous calculations to provide context.

**6. Layout:**
   - **Constraint Layout:** The app uses a constraint layout to ensure buttons and display elements are well-organized and easy to access.

This project demonstrates the development of a functional and user-friendly calculator app that can handle a wide range of mathematical operations. The emphasis is on providing a reliable tool for calculations, whether they are simple arithmetic tasks or complex scientific computations.
